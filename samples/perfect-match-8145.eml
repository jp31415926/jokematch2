Joe Bob and Lucas weren't exactly known in their little home town for being very bright. In fact, after a rather unfortunate incident involving duct tape, plastic forks, ketchup and 14 gallons of shampoo, they were court ordered to stay apart from each other.

So, they texted each other instead...

Week 1:

Joe Bob: "I was thinking about getting some raffle tickets at the gas station. Top prize is a year's worth of gas."
Lucas: "Ok. Put me down for 5 tickets."
Joe Bob: "Ok."

So, Joe Bob bought 10 tickets at a dollar each, and they waited.

Week 2:

Joe Bob: "Hey, I got 3rd place... a year's supply of spaghetti sauce and spaghetti noodles!"
Lucas: "I got 6th place... a toilet brush."

Week 3:

Joe Bob: "I'm really enjoying my spaghetti! I have it every night! How do you like your toilet brush?"
Lucas: "Not so much... I think I'm just going to go back to paper."
