COUNTDOWN TO DESTRUCTION ...


On New Year's Eve, a lady stood up at the local pub and said that it was
time to get ready for the celebrations.

At the stroke of midnight, she wanted every husband to be standing next
to the one person who made his life worth living.

Well, it was kind of embarrassing. The bartender was almost crushed to
death.
